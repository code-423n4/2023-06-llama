And the repository is very well documented, along with setup instructions, natspec, system context diagrams and a video walkthrough.

Hey, I just want to be sure I got it right: so at first user creates an Action, then it shoud be approve\disapproved via _cast functions, later it goes to Queue, and finaly user calls Execute func. Is it correct?


[06/09/2023 13:45] dd0sxx
rougly speaking yes. this diagram does a good job showing the action flow

[06/09/2023 13:46] dd0sxx
approvals happen in the active state, if the threshhold is reached the action is then in the approved state. the action gets queued, which allows users to disapprove the action

{Reactions}
👍 

[06/09/2023 13:46] dd0sxx
if the action is not disapproved, it can then be executed, or it will expire if not executed in time


[06/09/2023 13:46] dd0sxx
at any stage the action creator and cancel the action, and if the action does not get approved, or does get disapproved, the action will move to the failed state which is terminal

Is the code base little different from what Spearbit audited or no changes at all?


[06/09/2023 22:02] austin.green
We have made some minor changes since the spearbit audit (mostly style changes). I can provide a list if you'd like


[06/09/2023 22:03] co0nan
thanks you, that will be helpful. 
So the issues from that audit are fixed right?


[06/09/2023 22:03] austin.green
Yeah every issue is fixed or acknowledged!


[06/09/2023 22:04] austin.green
The only change we made that isn't a documentation change or naming change is adding the ability for the root llama instance to add multiple account implementation contracts similar to how strategies work


[06/09/2023 22:05] austin.green
```
* New `ILlamaAccount` interface
* Replacing all occurences of `LlamaAccount` with `ILlamaAccount`
throughout the codebase.
* `LlamaAccount` now implements `ILlamaAccount`
* `authorizedAccountLogics` mapping in `LlamaFactory`
* Account Logic contracts authorized in `LlamaFactory` as part of the
factory construction and `authorizeAccountLogic()` function which sets
`authorizedAccountLogics` mapping to true and emits
`AccountLogicAuthorized` event.
* `_deployAccounts` in `LlamaCore` now has a check to see if the Llama
Account logic contract is an authorized one and reverts with a
`UnauthorizedAccountLogic` error if not.
* Updated `computeLlamaAccountAddress` function signature in
`LlamaLens`.
* Relevant Tests and updated existing tests to reflect changes in event
and function signatures.
* Updated initial parameters in input jsons used for initial deploy and
action creation.
* Removing all occurences of `payable` for `ILlamaAccount`
* `ILlamaAccount` `initialize()` function takes `bytes memory config` as
input parameter instead of `string memory name` to make it generalizable
for future Account Logic contracts.
* Path change: `src/LlamaAccount.sol` -> `src/accounts/LlamaAccount.sol`
* Removing certain indexed fields on `StrategyAuthorized`,
`AccountCreated` and `ScriptAuthorized` events which are unique and have
no need to be indexed.
```

[06/09/2023 22:06] austin.green
these are the changes that needed to be made to implement this feature


[06/10/2023 16:21] co0nan
who is allowed to `_deploy` new instance? is it an owner privilege?


[06/10/2023 17:50] dd0sxx
the llama factory deploys new instanves and that is governed by the root llama instance controlled by Llama the organization (the sponsors of the contest)

{Reactions}
thankyou (2) 

[06/11/2023 05:34] ernestognw
Hey, what is the rationale to pass the whole `description` in `memory` during Action creation? I'm asking for LlamaCore.sol's `createAction`

@Austin | Llama 🦙 dmed you

pepe_llama 

[06/11/2023 12:28] austin.green
Do you mean instead of passing it as calldata?


[06/11/2023 17:11] ernestognw
Oh no, it's because it's not stored anywhere other than emitted by the `ActionCreated` event and hashed in `_getCreateActionTypedDataHash`. I wonder if there's a reason I'm missing to pass the value in parameters (either `calldata` or `memory`) instead of not passing it at all or just passing its hash.


[06/11/2023 17:45] dd0sxx
we need the description in the event so we can save it to our db and display it on the ui

Just delete the `.svm/` directory in your home directory and do `foundryup` and `forge build` again. It happens sometimes with forge.
